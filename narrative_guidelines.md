# VibeManga Narrative & Categorization Guidelines

This file defines the **PRIMARY INTENT** and rules for organizing the manga library.
These rules take precedence over standard genre/tag matching.

## 1. The "Adult" Threshold
**Do not blindly trust 'Ecchi' or 'Mature' tags.**
- **ADULT:** If the *primary draw* is sexual titillation, erotica, or pornography.
- **ACTION / ROMANCE / SLICE:** If ecchi/fanservice is incidental to a main plot of fighting, adventure, romance, or comedy.

## 2. The "Source" Check
- **ADAPTATIONS:** Artbooks, Anthologies, or adaptations from video games, physical card games, movies, TV shows, or novels (not originally manga).
    - *Examples:* Pokemon, Dragon Quest, Zelda, Star Wars.
- **EXCEPTIONS:** If the adaptation is heavily reimagined with a unique plot (e.g., Fate series, Hellsing), sort by genre (ACTION, WORLDS, etc.).

## 3. The "Food & Hobby" Check
- **SLICE (Hobby, Food & Performing Arts):** Main focus is on cooking, crafting, arts, or non-sports hobbies.
    - *Examples:* Food Wars!, Blue Period.
    - *Overrides:* "Action" (even if tournament-based) and "Sports".

## 4. The "System/Origin" Check (ISEKAI)
Use **ISEKAI** if the protagonist:
- Is from Earth (Reincarnated/Transmigrated) in a different world/time (e.g., Re:Zero, Mushoku Tensei).
- Is using a VRMMO, System UI, or Leveling mechanics in a fantasy setting (e.g., Sword Art Online, Solo Leveling).

## 5. The "Goal" Check
- **ACTION (Sports):** If the main goal is winning a championship or competition. *Overrides School Life.*
